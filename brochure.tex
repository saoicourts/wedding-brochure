Thank you so much for coming out to see us and to celebrate our marriage!
We are so blessed to have such a loving and supportive family and we're excited to 
get to spend some quality time with you over the next couple of days!

\section{Events}
We have set up a series of events that you can choose to attend if you
are feeling up for it, but we also want you to feel free to explore our
wonderful city by yourself and ``choose your own adventure,'' if you feel so inclined.

To that effect, we have set up a loose schedule for this weekend that you should 
feel free to follow as closely as you desire! All of the following events
(besides the wedding celebration dinner Monday night) are completely optional! We will be there
and you're sure to run into some other friendly faces as well.

\section{Saturday Event Details}
Here you can read a bit more about the things we've planned to see which of them tickle your fancy.

\subsection{Saturday Dinner at Peddler Brewing}
\label{subsec-dinner-sat}
\begin{center}
    \texttt{1514 NW Leary Way, Seattle, WA 98107}
\end{center}

\section{Sunday Event Details}
\subsection{Discovery Park Hike and Picnic Lunch}
This is one of Nico's absolute favorite spaces in the city. When he first arrived he was amazed 
by all the huge green spaces all around us and made it his quest to visit them all. The placement of 
this park played no small role in our decision to move to Magnolia. Now we live right next door and Nico gets to go running in the park
before school!\hfill
\label{subsec-discovery}

Discovery is the largest park in the city of Seattle. It clocks in at 534 acres and it captures
a huge variety of different biomes. You can get (truly) lost among the trees in the vast
forested areas or stroll through a meadow to come to stunning bluffs overlooking Puget sound.

You can meet us at \textbf{10~am} on Sunday for a brisk walk through the forest and along the cliffs
to a cozy beach with a lighthouse and back. It's about 5mi round trip and there are about 400' of stairs
to climb but we won't be pushing too hard so hopefully anyone can join. If you'd prefer to skip it, you are 
still welcome to join us at noon for some food in the park (which will be provided).

Just search for \textbf{Discovery Park East Parking Lot} in your favorite maps app and you will be led right there. For those of you
staying in Ballard, you can even try walking across the locks if you're looking for an extra bit of exercise. We love heading
down that path (in the opposite direction) for Sunday brunch. :)

\section{Things to Do and See in Seattle}
\label{sec-things-to-do}
We've pulled together our combined recommendations for things to do, see, and eat.
Hopefully these things float your boat!
\renewcommand\thesubsubsection{\arabic{subsubsection}}

\subsection{Bites to Eat}

\subsubsection{\textit{Perch\'e No}}
\begin{center}
    \texttt{1319 N 49th St Seattle, WA, 98103}
\end{center}
This wonderful restaurant is where Allison and Nico had one of their very first dates!
It is an Italian restaurant owned and run by a Korean couple -- he is the head chef and 
she works the front of the house -- and it's to die for. 

It has a fun ambiance and the whole restaurant surrounds a big open kitchen where you can 
watch the chef boil up your fresh house-made pasta and enjoy a glass of wine from their 
extensive wine list. On our first trip the owner came up to us and told us all about her son 
who just started a food truck -- she was so proud!

\subsubsection{\textit{Mondello Ristorante Italiano}}
\begin{center}
    \texttt{2425 33rd Ave W \#3 Seattle, WA 98199}
\end{center}
Speaking of incredible Italian food, \textit{Mondello} is our new secret spot (shhh...) 
to take people from out of town. Come inside and you are in your family's kitchen (or 
maybe some idealized version that cleans up) and a sweet Sicilian lady will come up and
treat you like one of her own. The food is authentic with a capital ``A'' and you'll 
swear that you have been magically transported to the south of Italy.

For an added bonus, you can pop next door for some Gelato from the Nutty Squirrel! They 
have gelato and sorbetto for the vegans among you.

\subsubsection{Dumpling Tzar}

\subsection{The Caf\'e Life}
Seattle is definitely known for its coffee scene, but these caf\'es have stood out to us as truly outstanding.
\subsubsection{Miro Tea}
\begin{center}
    \texttt{5405 Ballard Ave NW, Seattle, WA 98107}
\end{center}

Okay, so it's not coffee. But if you are a tea drinker like Nico you will almost certainly
find something you love. They have some outstanding Chinese tea (Nico always gets a \textit{gaiwan} of \textit{puerh} tea)
and some friendly staff who know what they're talking about.

The best part is that, if you're staying in Ballard, it's right around the corner!

\subsection{Bars and Nightlife}
Looking to shake your groove thing or get your drank on? Luckily there are some happening
spots for you hep cats.
\subsubsection{Pie Bar Ballard}
\begin{center}
    \texttt{2218 NW Market St, Seattle, WA 98107}
\end{center}

As you probably know, Allison can't have gluten and Nico doesn't drink. Luckily that isn't a problem 
for them because Pie Bar is a thing! Right down the street from the Ballard Hotel sits this warm
little shop with a cozy ambiance where you can go alone or with a group to go grab a slice and/or a cocktail.

People are friendly and the pie is great and you'd be hard pressed to have a bad time here.

\subsection{Touristy Stuff}
What kind of city guide would this be if we didn't include the stuff that tourists like 
to do? If you ask a Seattlite, they'd never be caught dead in these places although secretly
we've all been to most of these places at least once.

You can find everything on the map below with the numbers corresponding to the number in each heading.

\subsubsection{Pike Place Market}
\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{fish.jpg}
\end{wrapfigure}
Don't you dare call it ``\textit{Pike's} place''! This is a bustling market right in the middle
of downtown that is famous for, among other things, the fishmongers who throw their fresh
fish back and forth. We love it for the fantastic deals you can get on fresh bouquets and the
cute hand-crafted goods you can find there.

If you're feeling nostalgic (and you have too much time on your hands) you can also visit the first Starbucks
which is located right across the street. We'd recommend walking about 500 feet down the street
and getting the \textit{exact same cup of coffee} from a more modern Starbucks with a fraction of the wait, however. :)

\subsubsection{Smith Tower}
Sure, you \textit{could} go to the space needle but honestly we've gone there and paid the \$40 fee to ride up in
the elevator and it's a bit of a bust. And this is on top of having to pay for parking and navigate the craziness
of downtown.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.5\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{smith.jpg}
\end{wrapfigure}

Instead, let us offer you the Smith Tower as an alternative. Have you ever wanted to feel like you 
were part of the 1920s upper crust? Well you're in luck because for the low, low price of \$20 you 
can get a historical tour of the building followed by a ride up in the elevator to the Observatory Bar,
a luxurious room with 360 degree views of Seattle and the Sound and one thing that you'll 
never see from the Space Needle: the Space Needle itself!

Allison absolutely fell in love with the tower when she first visited when she was younger
and has since convinced Nico to love it (almost) as much.

You can also choose to visit after hours (after 9pm) to shave \$8 off the admission price.
